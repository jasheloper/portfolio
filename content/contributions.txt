From time to time, I share some of my favorite software tools that I use via my YouTube tech channel. ScreenPal is one of them that I use to create all my screen recordings and clips. The ScreenPal team found my video and invited me to write a blog post to talk more about how I use this tool in my everyday life.

I previously wrote a blog post where I shared some HTML code nuggets that I find very useful. The team at Onymos really liked this post and invited me as a guest blogger.
