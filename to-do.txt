thoughts:
about me: implement. whether it's problem solving or...?

design: are the boxes too wide for each section?

projects: should there just be 1 large project and then the others in 2 column rows?

skills: the skill kbd's seem to take a while to load on one of my devices and makes it look off initially. is it the custom css i have?
