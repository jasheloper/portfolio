thoughts:

about me: implement. whether it's problem solving or...?

skills: the skill kbd's seem to take a while to load on one of my devices and makes it look off initially. is it the custom css i have?
*i think phone just needed a software update - seems resolved now 
*tested, it's actually still loading oddly on my smaller iphone but it eventually resolves.

----

possible later features:
a nav clicking to sections

projects: should there just be 1 large project and then the others in 2 column rows?
